Use Dog API to build an application where users can view an image gallery of their favorite dog breeds.

Users should be able to select one or more dog breeds.
Selecting a breed should display images of that breed in the gallery.
While those are the only basic requirements, we encourage you to build out extra features that you think would be helpful—or just interesting to implement—to set your exercise apart.
